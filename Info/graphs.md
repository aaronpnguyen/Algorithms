## Graphs

### Basics
- Graphs are known as nodes and edges
    - Nodes are values
    - Edges are connections to nodes (Connection between a pair of nodes)

- Directed graphs force us to traverse in the direction given
- Undirected graphs allow us to traverse to any neighbor

- Adjacency List
    - Usually a hashmap to show the relationship nodes have, example:

```js
{
    a: [b, c],  // Node a can traverse either node b or c
    b: [d],     // Node b can traverse to node d
    c: [e],     // Node c can traverse to node e
    d: [],      // Node d does not have a relationship with another node
    e: [b],     // Node e can traverse to node b
    f: [d],     // Node f can traverse to node f
}
```
Imagine the value pair being the neighboring nodes to the key

### Depth First Traversal
- Traverse vertically, meaning that you will only traverse through a node's neighbors until it doesn't have one, starting at the root
- Explore one direction as far as possible

```mermaid
graph LR;
    subgraph First Traversal
    a --> b
    b --> d
    d --> f
    end
    subgraph Second Traversal
    a --> c
    c --> e
    end
```

#### Implementation
- Depth First
  - Implements with a stack, last in first out
  - When removing a node at the top of the stack, the neighboring nodes will be added to the top

```mermaid

direction LR

1 --> 2
2 --> 3
3 --> 4
4 --> 5
5 --> 6


class 1 {
    a
    stack()
}
note for 1 "add a to the top of the stack"

class 2 {
    b
    c
    stack()
}
note for 2 "when a is popped, add its neighbor b"

class 3 {
    d
    c
    stack()
}
note for 3 "when b is popped, add its neighbor d"

class 4 {
    f
    c
    stack()
}
note for 4 "when d is popped, add its neighbor f"

class 5 {
    c
    stack()
}
note for 5 "when f is popped, it does not have anymore neighbors, so go to the root's neighbor"

class 6 {
    e
    stack()
}
note for 6 "when c is popped, add its neighbor e"
note "when the stack is empty, the algorithm is finished"
```

* This ultimately prints a, b, d, f, c, e
#### Code
Iteratively: 
```js
const depthFirstPrint = (graph, source) => {
    const stack = [source];

    while (stack.length > 0) {
      const currentNode = stack.pop(); // Removes last index

      console.log(currenntNode);

      for (let neighbor of graph[current]) {
        stack.push(neighbor); // Adds to the back of the array
      };
    };
};
```
Recursively:
```js
// Does not have an explicit base case,
// Implicit base case is when a node has empty neighbors and cannot be iterated
const depthFirstPrint = (graph, source) => {
    console.log(source);

    for (let neighbor of graph[source]) {
        depthFirstPrint(graph, neighbor);
    };
};
```


### Breadth First Traversal
  - Traverse horizontally, meaning that you must traverse through a node's neighbors at the same time before going to the next set of neighbors
  - Explore node neighbors evenly

```mermaid
graph LR;
    subgraph First Traversal
    a --> b
    a --> c
    end
    subgraph Second Traversal
    b --> d
    c --> e
    end
    subgraph Third Traversal
    d --> f
    end
```

#### Implementation
- Breadth First
  - Implements with a queue, first in first out
  - When removing the first node, its neighboring nodes will be added to the end of the queue

```mermaid
---

classDiagram
direction LR

1 --> 2
2 --> 3
3 --> 4

class 1 {
    a
    queue()
}
note for 1 "a is the start of the queue"

class 2 {
    b
    c
    queue()
}
note for 2 "a is out of the queue, and we add b and c in that order"

class 3 {
    d
    e
    queue()
}
note for 3 "similar to before, remove b then c, and add d and e"

class 4 {
    f
    queue()
}
note for 4 "there are no more neighbors, so f is added to the queue and removed in the next iteration"
note "when the queue is empty, the algorithm is finished"
```
* This ultimately prints a, b, c, d, e, f

#### Code
Iteratively:
```js
const breadthFirstPrint = (graph, source) => {
    const queue = [source];

    while (queue.length > 0) {
        const currentNode = queue.shift(); // Removes index 0
        
        console.log(currentNode);

        for (let neighbor of graph[currentNode]) {
            queue.push(neighbor); // Adds to end of the array
        };
    };
};
```
